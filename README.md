Title: Terrapin Maps

Mission Statement: 

The goal of this website is to give a new spin to the UMD Campus Map website by adding filtering options and a new outlook on the site. The buildings are organized by their building name, longitude and latitude location, and the purpose of the building. The user has the choice to filter by the name of the building or filter by the purpose of each building. 

Target Browsers: The website is optimized to run on browsers such as Google Chrome and Safari, but has the structure to run on mobile devices such as Andriod and IOS. The website is best displayed on a desktop browser but has mobile capabilities. 

API: https://api.umd.io/v1/map/buildings

Visualization: The main visualization being displayed on this website features a map using an open street map and the external library, Leaflet. The map displays the indicated and filtered buildings based on their longitude and latitude location.
